"Epicurus","Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?  "
"Alan Moore","The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory, is that conspiracy theorists believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is actually chaotic. The truth is that it is not The Iluminati, or The Jewish Banking Conspiracy, or the Gray Alien Theory.The truth is far more frightening - Nobody is in control.The world is rudderless"

"Ralph Waldo Emerson","The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be."
"William Shakespeare","Hell is empty and all the devils are here."
"Joseph Conrad","The danger, when not seen, has the imperfect vagueness of human thought. The fear grows shadowy; and Imagination, the enemy of men, the father of all terrors, unstimulated, sinks to rest in the dullness of exhausted emotion."
"Confucius","It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop."
"Marcus Aurelius","Frame your thoughts like this—you are an old person, you won’t let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a puppet by every impulse, and you’ll stop complaining about your present fortune or dreading the future."

"Bertrand Russell","The hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross and which to burn."
"du Vair","I find that most of the time we envy others for their wealth, honor, and privilege; but if someone were to say to us, 'You can have the same amount that they have for the same price,' we would not want it. For in order to have these things that they do, we must flatter, we must endure insult and injury, we must give up our freedoms."
"George Bernard Shaw","The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can't find them, make them."
"Epictetus","These reasonings do not cohere: I am richer than you, therefore I am better than you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than you. On the contrary these rather cohere, I am richer than you, therefore my possessions are greater than yours: I am more eloquent than you, therefore my speech is superior to yours. But you are neither possession nor speech."
"Anonymous","There are more knives out and backs being stabbed than in a bordello in Caracas on a Saturday night."
"David O'Regan","The external world does not impose itself upon our consciousness, we control our moods, thoughts, attitudes, and choices. So Sisyphus is free because he is in control of his moods, thoughts, attitudes and choices. Neither the gods, the rock nor the mountain determine how he feels."

"Francisco Goya","When reason sleeps, monsters are born."
"Friedrich Nietzsche","Those who know they are profound strive for clarity. Those who want to seem profound strive  for obscurity."
"Voltaire","Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd."
"Anne Lamott","Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft. I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won’t have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren’t even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they’re doing it."
"Marcus Aurelius","Stop being aimless, stop allowing fears and anger to lead you astray. Instead, focus on doing what has to be done right now willingly, with precision, seriousness, and integrity.Free yourself from distractions. You can do it, if you approach each task as if it were your last."

"Vladimir Ilyich Lenin","There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."
"Marcus Aurelius","I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others."
"Simon Blackburn","...the idea being that only when we can see ourselves properly can we obtain control over the direction in which we would wish to move."

"Unknown","IBM had/have a credo that a purchaser values their purchase in relation to the price they paid for it. Keep giving someone something for nothing and that is the value they put on it."

"Christopher Hitchens","When the Washington Post telephoned me at home on Valentine's Day 1989 to ask my opinion about the Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwah, I felt at once that here was something that completely committed me. It was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual, and the defense of free expression. Plus, of course, friendship—though I like to think that my reaction would have been the same if I hadn't known Salman at all."

"Anonymous","Be a fountain, not a drain. Create more, consume less."
"Epictetus","Keep in mind that it isn’t the one who has it in for you and takes a swipe that harms you, but rather the harm comes from your own belief about the abuse. So when someone arouses your anger, know that it’s really your own opinion fueling it. Instead, make it your first response not to be carried away by such impressions, for with time and distance self-mastery is more easily achieved."
"Seneca","We should not, like sheep, follow the herd of creatures in front of us, making our way where others go, not where we ought to go."
"Epictetus","...freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart's desire, but by removing your desire."
"Friedrich Nietzsche","Examine the life of the best and most productive men and nations, and ask yourselves whether a tree which is to grow proudly skywards can dispense with bad weather and storms. Whether misfortune and opposition, or every kind of hatred, jealousy, stubbornness, distrust, severity, greed, and violence do not belong to the favourable conditions without which a great growth even of virtue is hardly possible?"
"Epictetus","We are like actors in a play. The divine will has assigned us our roles in life without consulting us. Some of us will act in a short drama, others in a long one. We might be assigned the part of a poor person, a cripple, a distinguished celebrity or public leader, or an ordinary private citizen. Although we can't control which roles are assigned to us, it must be our business to act our given role as best as we possibly can and to refrain from complaining about it. Wherever you find yourself and in whatever circumstances, give an impeccable performance."
"Voltaire","Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool."

"Epictetus","Suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power."
"Stephen Jay Gould","I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."
"Epictetus","What is bad luck? Opinion. What are conflict, dispute, blame, accusation, irreverence, and frivolity? They are all opinions, and more than that, they are opinions that lie outside of our own reasoned choice, presented as if they were good or evil. Let a person shift their opinions only to what belongs in the field of their own choice, and I guarantee that person will have peace of mind, whatever is happening around them."
"Anonymous","The world needs neither kings nor gods. Nor little men who claims to serve them."
"Matthew Kelly","The people we surround ourselves with either raise or lower our standards. They either help us to become the best version of ourselves or encourage us to become lesser versions of ourselves. We become like our friends. No man becomes great on his own. No woman becomes great on her own. The people around them help to make them great.We all need people in our lives who raise our standards, remind us of our essential purpose, and challenge us to become the best version of ourselves."

"Mark Twain","Sometimes I wonder if the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it."
"Stephen Fry","Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - 'It destroys everything around it, except itself '."
"Anonymous","In my experience, companies today want the benefits of the IBM Way—loyalty from employees who live for the company culture--without extending benefits in return.Companies today are like the man who says he's in an open marriage but his wife doesn't know it."
"Keith Caserta","Worry is the interest you pay on a debt you may not owe."
"Seneca","It is the mark of a great mind to rise above insults; the most humiliating kind of revenge is to treat your adversary as not worth taking revenge upon. Many have taken slight injuries too deeply to heart in the course of punishing them. The great and noble are those who, like a lordly beast, listen unmoved to the barking of little dogs."
"Sheldon Cooper","There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village, they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin.Superstitious nonsense, of course - but one can see their point."

"Sitting Bull","Yet hear me, people, we have now to deal with another race – small and feeble when our fathers first met them but now great and overbearing. Strangely enough they have a mind to till the soil and the love of possession is a disease with them. These people have made many rules that the rich may break but the poor may not. They take their tithes from the poor and weak to support the rich and those who rule."
"Anonymous","Think of your mind like a pond full of fish and each fish is a feeling. Try to be the pond, not the fish."
"John Gardner","Self-pity is easily the most destructive of the non-pharmaceutical narcotics; it is addictive, gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality."
"Marcus Aurelius","These are the characteristics of the rational soul: self-awareness, self-examination, and self-determination. It reaps its own harvest. . . . It succeeds in its own purpose . . ."

"Seneca","I was shipwrecked before I even boarded . . . the journey showed me this—how much of what we have is unnecessary, and how easily we can decide to rid ourselves of these things whenever it’s necessary, never suffering the loss."
"Carl Sagan","We’ve arranged a global civilization in which the most crucial elements […] profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. [...] Sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces."
"Albert Einstein","Weak people revenge. Strong people forgive. Intelligent people ignore."
"Seneca","We are not able by means of reason to escape from that first impression on the mind, any more than we can escape from those things which we have mentioned as occurring to the body: we cannot prevent other people's yawns tempting us to yawn: we cannot help winking when fingers are suddenly darted at our eyes. Reason is unable to overcome these habits, which perhaps might be weakened by practice and constant watchfulness: they differ from an emotion which is brought into existence and brought to an end by a deliberate mental act."

"Seneca","When you see someone often flashing their rank or position, or someone whose name is often bandied about in public, don’t be envious; such things are bought at the expense of life. . . .Some die on the first rungs of the ladder of success, others before they can reach the top, and the few that make it to the top of their ambition through a thousand indignities realize at the end it’s only for an inscription on their gravestone."
"Robert G. Ingersoll","Religion supports nobody. It has to be supported. It produces no wheat, no corn; it ploughs no land; it fells no forests. It is a perpetual mendicant. It lives on the labors of others, and then has the arrogance to pretend that it supports the giver."
"Mark Twain","I’ve suffered a great many catastrophes in my life. Most of them never happened."
"Epictetus","Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand, and take a moderate share. Does it pass you? Do not stop it. Is it not come yet? Do not yearn in desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized."

"Carl Sagan","One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us..."
"Seneca","The best plan is to reject straightaway the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition."
"Marcus Aurelius","Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."

"Charles Bukowski","The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence. The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts."

"Marcus Aurelius","Don’t let yourself forget how many doctors have died, after furrowing their brows over how many deathbeds. How many astrologers, after pompous forecasts about others’ ends. How many philosophers, after endless disquisitions on death and immortality. How many warriors, after inflicting thousands of casualties themselves. How many tyrants, after abusing the power of life and death atrociously, as if they were themselves immortal. How many whole cities have met their end: Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and countless others. And all the ones you know yourself, one after another. One who laid out another for burial, and was buried himself, and then the man who buried him—all in the same short space of time. In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash. To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint. Like an olive that ripens and falls. Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on."
"Marcus Aurelius","Get busy with life's purpose, toss aside empty hopes, get active in your own rescue - if you care for yourself at all - and do it while you can."
"Scott D. Weitzenhoffer","Debating creationists on the topic of evolution is rather like trying to play chess with a pigeon; it knocks the pieces over, craps on the board, and flies back to its flock to claim victory."
"Seneca","It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor."
"Friedrich Nietzsche","Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."

"Seneca","There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more arrogant, if foiled, none more insane—since it’s not driven back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes its adversary it turns its teeth on itself."
"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","People speak sometimes about the "bestial" cruelty of man, but that is terribly unjust and offensive to beasts, no animal could ever be so cruel as a man, so artfully, so artistically cruel."
"Francisco Goya","Imagination abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters: united with her, she is the mother of the arts and the source of her wonders."

"Friedrich Nietzsche","The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to whomever he encounters."
